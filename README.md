# Questionnaire Designer

This is a team collaboration platform. The platform allows team leaders to create custom questionnaires to send out to new members.

## Description

I my form a team leader could name the form, add inputs such as checkboxes, radio buttons, input fields and date fields. Most inpouts have labels and they will be updated in real time while you write them.
The form can be saved in the db.json file and a initial template will be loaded for you when the project reloads.
You are able to rearange inputs and delete them at will.

I have made the project in Vite, "a blazing fast frontend build tool powering the next generation of web applications", because of its speed and simplicity of configuration.

I have used CSS modules for styling because it gives me more control of the styling and prevents styles from bleeding over to other components.
